# 100 Days of Code - Python

This repository documents my progress and projects during the 100 Days of Code challenge in Python. The challenge involves coding consistently for 100 days to enhance my programming skills, build projects, and improve problem-solving abilities.

## Motivation

The purpose of this challenge is to dedicate focused time and effort to learn, practice, and apply Python programming concepts. By committing to coding every day for 100 days, I aim to reinforce fundamental concepts, explore new topics, and gain practical experience through projects.

## Rules

1. Code for a minimum of one hour every day for 100 consecutive days.
2. The code must be written in Python.
3. Log the progress every day to track the journey.


## Projects

Throughout the challenge, I will work on various projects to apply the knowledge gained and reinforce learning.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in following along or participating in the challenge, here's how you can get started:

1. Fork this repository (or create your own repository).
2. Set up your local development environment with Python.
3. Start coding and commit your progress regularly.
4. Customize the README.md and progress.md files to track your own journey.
5. Optionally, create a blog or social media account to share your progress and connect with the community.
